# e-conomic API PHP examples
##Examples for basic e-conomic SOAP API and REST API interaction.

We advice that you use our REST API if it covers your needs today. The REST API is where our development resources are focused. Our SOAP API is still supported although in feature freeze.

For in-context examples of using the REST API please see the REST API Documentation: http://restdocs.e-conomic.com/
